# House Price Prediction

For this problem, you need to implement a regression model capable of predicting the value of a house (`Price`) using an available dataset. The dataset is organized in a CSV file, and the model's performance will be evaluated based on the **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**.

**The dataset contains the following columns:**

- `Square_Footage`: Area of the house.
- `Num_Bedrooms`: Number of bedrooms.
- `Num_Bathrooms`: Number of bathrooms.
- `Year_Built`: Year the house was built.
- `Lot_Size`: Size of the lot.
- `Garage_Size`: Size of the garage.
- `Neighborhood_Quality`: Quality of the neighborhood.
- `Footage_to_Lot_Ratio`: Ratio between house area and lot size.
- `Total_Rooms`: Total number of rooms.
- `Age_of_House`: Age of the house.
- `Garage_to_Footage_Ratio`: Ratio between garage size and house area.
- `Avg_Room_Size`: Average room size.
- `Price`: Target variable, house price (numerical value, prediction objective).
- `House_Orientation_Angle`: Orientation angle of the house.
- `Street_Alignment_Offset`: Street alignment.
- `Solar_Exposure_Index`: Solar exposure index.
- `Magnetic_Field_Strength`: Magnetic field strength.
- `Vibration_Level`: Vibration level.

## Tasks

### Subtask 1 (10 points)

For each house in the test set, determine the estimated total area as the sum of the house area (`Square_Footage`), garage size (`Garage_Size`), and lot size (`Lot_Size`).

### Subtask 2 (10 points)

For each house in the test set, calculate the ratio between the garage size (`Garage_Size`) and the total number of rooms (`Total_Rooms`). The result should be added as a new column called `Garage_to_Room_Ratio`.

### Subtask 3 (10 points)

For each house in the test set, calculate the environmental stability index, defined as the difference between the solar exposure index (`Solar_Exposure_Index`) and the vibration level (`Vibration_Level`), divided by the magnetic field strength (`Magnetic_Field_Strength`).

```python
Env_Stability_Index = (Solar_Exposure_Index - Vibration_Level) / Magnetic_Field_Strength
```

### Subtask 4 (10 points)

Using the training dataset, calculate the mean value of the `Square_Footage` column, representing the average house area in the training set.
Then, for each house in the test set, determine the absolute value of the difference between the actual house area (`Square_Footage`) and the average calculated from the training set.

### Subtask 5 (60 points)

The main goal of this task is to build a machine learning regression model that can predict `Price` based on the features provided in the dataset. The model must generalize well to new data and will be evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

Implement a regression model to predict the `Price` field, using the training set `train_data.csv`. Generate predictions on the evaluation set provided in the `test_data.csv` file (this file does not contain the Price column).

## Notes about the dataset

The target field is `Price`, a numerical value representing the house price.

Numerical variables (`Square_Footage`, `Num_Bedrooms`, `Num_Bathrooms`, `Year_Built`, `Lot_Size`, `Garage_Size`, `Footage_to_Lot_Ratio`, `Total_Rooms`, `Age_of_House`, `Garage_to_Footage_Ratio`, `Avg_Room_Size`, `House_Orientation_Angle`, `Street_Alignment_Offset`, `Solar_Exposure_Index`, `Magnetic_Field_Strength`, `Vibration_Level`) can be directly used for regression.

It is recommended to check and handle missing values (if any) and to normalize/scale the features to improve model performance.

## Evaluation Criteria

Performance: The model should have as low an MAE as possible.

### Note
If you submit `sample_output.csv`, you will receive 5 points.
