# Patient Status Prediction

For this problem, you need to implement a machine learning model to predict the value of the `Status` field using an available dataset containing information about patients. The dataset is organized in a CSV file that includes various features, and the evaluation of the model will be based on the precision for the `Dead` class.

**The dataset contains the following fields, each with its corresponding meaning:**

- `Age`: The patient's age.
- `Race`: The patient's race (e.g., White, Other).
- `Marital Status`: The patient's marital status (Married, Single, Divorced, etc.).
- `T Stage`: Tumor stage, according to the TNM staging system (e.g., T1, T2, T3, T4).
- `N Stage`: Degree of lymph node involvement (N0, N1, etc.).
- `6th Stage`: Cancer stage according to the 6th edition TNM classification.
- `differentiate`: Tumor differentiation grade (Well differentiated, Moderately differentiated, Poorly differentiated).
- `Grade`: Histological grade of the tumor (1, 2, 3, etc.).
- `A Stage`: Disease stage classification (e.g., Regional).
- `Tumor Size`: Tumor size measured in a relevant unit (may contain missing values).
- `BMI`: The patient's body mass index.
- `Heart Rate`: The patient's heart rate.
- `Serum Creatinine`: Serum creatinine level.
- `Uric Acid`: Blood uric acid level.
- `Hemoglobin`: Hemoglobin concentration in the blood.
- `GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate)`: Glomerular filtration rate, an indicator of kidney function.
- `Serum Sodium`: Serum sodium concentration.
- `Serum Potassium`: Serum potassium concentration.
- `Serum Albumin`: Serum albumin level.
- `Lactate`: Blood lactate concentration.
- `Status`: The patient’s status, with possible values “Dead” or “Alive” (target field for prediction).

## Tasks

For the initial tasks, you will need to load the dataset and perform a series of statistical analyses to better understand the dataset you will be working with.

### Subtask 1 (10 points)

For each patient in the test set, classify kidney function into one of the two categories, based on the `GFR` (Glomerular Filtration Rate) value:

- `Normal` if GFR >= 90
- `Mildly Decreased` if 60 <= GFR < 90

### Subtask 2 (10 points)

Use the training dataset to calculate the quartiles of values in the `Serum Creatinine` column.

Quartiles are statistical thresholds that divide the distribution of values into an equal number of parts:

- **Q1:** value below which 25% of the values fall
- **Q2:** median value (50% below, 50% above)
- **Q3:** value below which 75% of observations fall

Based on these thresholds, determine one of the four risk levels for each patient in the test set:

- `Very Low` – if `Serum Creatinine` <= Q1
- `Low` – if Q1 < `Serum Creatinine` <= Q2
- `High` – if Q2 < `Serum Creatinine` <= Q3
- `Very High` – if `Serum Creatinine` > Q3

### Subtask 3 (10 points)

Based on the training set, determine the mean `BMI` value. Then, for each patient in the test set, determine if the `BMI` value is strictly greater than the median. For patients whose `BMI` is greater than the median determined from the training set, write the value 1. For the rest, write 0.

### Subtask 4 (10 points)

For each patient in the test set, determine the number of patients from the training set who are in the same tumor stage (based on the `T Stage` attribute) as that patient.

### Subtask 5 (60 points)

The main goal of this task is to build a machine learning model to predict the patient’s status (`Status`) based on the provided features. The evaluation will be based on the model’s precision for predicting the value “Dead” (which represents the patient’s death).

## Notes about the dataset

- The target field is `Status`, and the goal is to predict whether a patient will be “Dead” or “Alive”.
- Some fields, such as `Tumor Size`, `BMI`, and `Serum Potassium`, are numeric and can be used directly by machine learning algorithms.
- It is important to note that the `Tumor Size` field may contain missing values (NaN), and this must be handled properly.
- Some columns may not be relevant for classification and need to be identified. It is recommended to analyze the correlation between variables and the target variable, and to remove those with low contribution or redundancy.
- Certain features may contain extreme values that could affect model performance. It is recommended to use statistical methods (IQR, Z-score) or visualizations (boxplot, histogram) to detect and treat these values.

## Evaluation Criteria

The evaluation metric used will be precision for the `Dead` class. You will evaluate the model’s performance in correctly predicting patients who will die.

### Note

If you submit `sample_output.csv`, you will receive 5 points.
