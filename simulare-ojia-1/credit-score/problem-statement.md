# Credit Score

## Overview

The dataset used for this challenge comes from a bank and contains information about users, with the goal of predicting whether a user is a good payer. The problem is a classification task with 3 possible labels associated with a client: `POOR CREDIT SCORE`, encoded as -1, `STANDARD CREDIT SCORE`, encoded as 0, and `GOOD CREDIT SCORE`, encoded as 1.

## Dataset description

The dataset in the file `train_data.csv` contains the following columns:

- `ID`: unique hexadecimal identification code for each row
- `Customer_ID`: unique identification code of the customer
- `Month`: month of the year
- `Name`: customer’s name
- `Age`: customer’s age in years
- `SSN`: customer’s social security number
- `Occupation`: customer’s occupation
- `Annual_Income`: customer’s annual income
- `Monthly_Inhand_Salary`: customer’s net monthly salary
- `Num_Bank_Accounts`: number of bank accounts the customer has
- `Num_Credit_Card`: number of credit cards owned by the customer
- `Interest_Rate`: interest rate
- `Num_of_Loan`: number of loans the customer has
- `Type_of_Loan`: a list containing the types of these loans
- `Delay_from_due_date`: delay from the due date
- `Num_of_Delayed_Payment`: number of payments made late
- `Changed_Credit_Limit`
- `Num_Credit_Inquiries`
- `Credit_Mix`
- `Outstanding_Debt`
- `Credit_Utilization_Ratio`
- `Credit_History_Age`
- `Payment_of_Min_Amount`
- `Total_EMI_per_month`
- `Amount_invested_monthly`
- `Payment_Behaviour`
- `Monthly_Balance`
- `Credit_Score`: one of the 3 possible labels associated with a client

The dataset in the file `test_data.csv` will contain the same columns except for the `Credit_Score` column.

## Requirements

### Subtask 1

How many rows of input are in the `train_data.csv` file?

### Subtask 2

Based on the data in `train_data.csv`, what is the average `Monthly_Inhand_Salary` of customers who have a `Credit_Utilization_Ratio` greater than or equal to 25? Display the floor (integer part) of this average.

### Subtask 3

Based on the data in `train_data.csv`, how many unique values are recorded for the `Month` attribute?

### Subtask 4

Based on the data in `train_data.csv`, how many unique `SSN` values end with 20?

### Subtask 5

Build a machine learning model to predict the credit score for each record in the test dataset (`test_data.csv`).

## Output format

The output file to be submitted as a `.csv` must contain 3 columns:

- `subtaskID` — represents the subtask number (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5).
- `datapointID` — refers to the `id` column in `test_data.csv`.
- `answer` — the corresponding answer for that datapoint for the given subtask.

**Note:** For subtasks 1-4, which require a single answer for the entire dataset, output only one line where `datapointID`is 1. For subtask 5, the answers must be values from the set `{ -1, 0, 1 }` corresponding to the label assigned to the client.

Submit a single CSV containing the answers for all subtasks you have solved. To see an example, download the `sample_output.csv` file.

## Scoring

- **Subtask 1:** 4 points
- **Subtask 2:** 5 points
- **Subtask 3:** 5 points
- **Subtask 4:** 6 points

For subtask 5, you will be scored based on accuracy (acc) as follows:

- acc < 0.4 => 0 points
- 0.4 <= acc < 0.5 => 10 points
- 0.5 <= acc < 0.6 => 25 points
- 0.6 <= acc < 0.7 => 55 points
- 0.7 <= acc < 0.75 => 65 points
- 0.75 <= acc => 80 points
