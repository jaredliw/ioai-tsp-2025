# Package Delivery

## Problem: Predicting On-Time Package Delivery

In modern logistics, on-time delivery of packages is essential for customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. Develop a model that predicts whether a package will be delivered on time (`on_time = 1`) or delayed (`on_time = 0`).

You will train the model using the provided training dataset and then generate predictions for an unlabeled dataset.

## Dataset Description

The **training dataset** (`train_data.csv`) contains the following columns:

- `id` (natural number): A unique identifier for the delivery.
- `distance_km` (0.5–700): Distance from the warehouse to the delivery destination (in kilometers). Shorter distances generally indicate a higher probability of on-time delivery.
- `package_weight_kg` (0.5–150): Weight of the package (in kilograms). Lighter packages are usually delivered faster.
- `traffic_level` (1–14): A level representing traffic conditions (integer type, 1 - low traffic, 14 - extremely heavy traffic).
- `on_time`: A binary variable where 1 indicates that the package was delivered on time, and 0 indicates a delay.

The **prediction dataset** (`test_data.csv`):

- Contains 50 samples with the same features (`id`, `distance_km`, `package_weight_kg`, and `traffic_level`) as the training set, but without the on_time column.
- Your model will generate predictions for these samples.

## Subtasks

- **Subtask 1 (20 pts):** `mean_traffic_level` – representing the mean of traffic levels in the prediction dataset, with precision to 2 decimal places.
- **Subtask 2 (20 pts):** `std_traffic_level` – representing the standard deviation of the same field (traffic level), also with 2 decimal places precision.
- **Subtask 3 (60 pts):** `on_time` – with your model's predictions, 1 for on-time delivery, and 0 for delay.

## Expected Output

A CSV file `output.csv` that includes the following 3 columns:

- `subtaskID` – represents the subtask number (1, 2, or 3).
- `datapointID` – refers to the `id` column from `test_data.csv`.
- `answer` – the corresponding answer for the datapoint for the respective subtask.

**Note:** For Subtasks 1 and 2, which require a single answer for the entire dataset, include only one line where `datapointID` is 1.

Submit a single CSV that includes answers for all subtasks you've solved. To see an example, download the file `sample_output.csv`.

## Scoring

Scores for the subtasks will be calculated as follows:

- **Subtasks 1 and 2:** 20 points if the precision difference between your result and the committee’s result is below 0.02, otherwise 0 points.
- **Subtask 3:** `round(min(max(60.0 * (acc - 0.8) / 0.178, 0), 60), 2)`, where `acc` is the accuracy you achieved.

**Note:** This problem has no final score different from the partial score. The score during the contest is the score you will keep.
