    "\n",
    "3. Mathematical odds: There are 5 dice total. The bid is for one 5. Considering 1s are wild, the bid is a 1/6 chance of being true on any given die, plus the wild, which makes it likely. Alice has a die, so it could be true. Without the wild, the chance is 1 - (5/6)^5 = 0.598. With a wild, it increases significantly, but is still less than 1. Because the previous bid was for two 5s, and the current bid is for one, I need to be careful.\n",

    "            GAME RULES:\n",
    "            1. Each player rolls hidden dice with faces from 1 to 6.\n",
    "            2. The game is played in turns.\n",
    "            3. On each turn, a player may either:\n",
    "               - Make a higher bid (as per the bid hierarchy).\n",
    "               - Make a challenge, that is, call the previous player's bluff.\n",
    "            4. Bid hierarchy increases first by quantity, then by face value. Example:\n",
    "               - 2 fives < 2 sixes < 3 ones < 3 twos < ... < 4 sixes.\n",
    "            5. A new bid must be strictly higher than the previous bid.\n",
    "            6. When \"CHALLENGE\" is called, all dice are rerevealed, and the total number of the face value in the last bid is counted.\n",
    "               - If the bid is valid (at least that many dice), the caller loses one die.\n",
    "               - If the bid is false, the bidder loses one die.\n",
    "            7. All dice are rerolled after each \"CHALLENGE\".\n",
    "            \n",
