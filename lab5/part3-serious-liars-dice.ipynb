      "   - **Llama's First Bid:** 3 dice show 4.\n",

      "     - **Challenge Outcome:** Llama wins the challenge.\n",

      "3. **Private Dice:**\n",

      "### Strategy\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Assessment of the Current Bid:**\n",
      "   - The current bid is 3 dice show 2.\n",
      "   - You have one dice showing 2.\n",
      "   - You do not have knowledge of the other 5 dice.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Evaluation of Challenging:**\n",
      "   - If you challenge, you need at least 3 dice showing 2 to win.\n",
      "   - Knowing that you have only one dice showing 2, and having no knowledge about the other 5 dice, it makes challenging risky.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Possible Bid Strategy:**\n",
      "   - To maintain the game's momentum and possibly trap your opponent with a challenging bid, you can make a bid with a different face value.\n",
      "   - Given the dice you know (4 and 2), you could potentially bid something more likely to be true, such as the number 4.\n",

      "\n",
      "Since the current bid is \"4 dice show 6,\" and we do not have any information on the visible dice, we must evaluate if it's reasonable to believe that 4 out of the 6 dice actually show 6. However, based on your private dice [5, 3], you know that at least two of the six dice do not show 6. That means there are at most 4 dice that could potentially show 6, and it's entirely possible that Mistral's claim is accurate. \n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, if you challenge, you are asserting that the bid is false. Given that the last bid was \"4 dice show 6,\" and you have not seen any evidence that contradicts it, it's not a strong position to challenge from. Unless the visible dice clearly contradict the number of 6s, challenging without evidence is risky.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you think the number of 6s is less than 4, you might consider making a challenge. However, since the number of dice that show 6 is not clearly visible, it's safer to make a bid that is more plausible based on the available information.\n",

      "Your private dice [5, 3] do not show a 6, so the highest number of 6s you can logically bid (based on your own knowledge) would be 3 or 4. Given that Mistral has already bid 4, you could bid 3 to make a conservative but logical move.\n",

      "1. **Previous Bids and Challenges:**\n",
      "   - Mistral bid 3 dice showing 4. Qwen challenged this and won, indicating that Mistral was bluffing.\n",
      "   - Subsequent bids were made, some of which were auto-corrected.\n",
      "   - The last bid was made by Gemma, claiming 6 dice showing 6.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Current Bid:**\n",
      "   - The current bid is 6 dice showing 6, made by Gemma.\n",
      "   - This is an extremely high bid, suggesting that Gemma potentially has 6 dice all showing 6.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Your Private Dice:**\n",
      "   - You have 1 private die showing 5.\n",
      "   - This does not help in challenging the current bid, as you need dice showing 6.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Considerations:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Risks of Challenging:**\n",
      "  - Challenging Gemma's bid of 6 dice showing 6 is risky because it is a very high bar to clear.\n",
      "  - If anyone else has dice showing 6, your challenge would fail, and Gemma would win.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Risks of Bidding:**\n",
      "  - Making a bid that is lower than the current bid would weaken your position.\n",
      "  - Any player can challenge your bid, and you could be forced to show your dice, revealing your single die showing 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Decision:\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the high risk involved in challenging such a strong bid, and the lack of dice showing 6 in your possession, it seems prudent to avoid making a bid that is easily challengeable. Instead, it might be wise to avoid bidding at this stage and potentially challenge later if the bids turn in your favor. Since challenging now is highly risky, waiting for a more opportune moment seems strategically sound.\n",

    "| Gemma | Performed well overall but showed a low success rate when initiating challenges. |\n",
    "| Mistral | Consistently ranked poorly and made frequent mistakes during challenges. |\n",
    "| Llama | Despite a high overall score, it had the highest rate of invalid moves—nearly double that of the others. In a small setup (`dice_per_player=2`), these auto-corrected decisions often happen to work out well. Tends to avoid challenges, possibly influenced by auto-correction also. |"
