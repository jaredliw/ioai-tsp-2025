# 𝁘 Byzantine Notation 𝁑

## Statement

Byzantine music is a genre with ancient origins, widespread throughout the Balkan region, with a history spanning more than a millennium. Its specific notation consists of a series of signs called neumes. The most important neumes are the vocalic ones, which guide the singing in an ascending, descending, or stationary manner along the tonal scale of the melody, with a meaning that is relative to the last note sung.

Implement an AI model that classifies the neumes from a sequence stored in an image, and use this model to produce a sequence representing, for each neume encountered, in the order from the image, the number of steps accumulated up to the current neume relative to the initial pitch (considered at the beginning of the sequence).

You are provided with a number of labeled sample images for training, each of size 48 by 48 pixels, each representing a single sign.

The training dataset is a CSV file containing the following fields with the following meanings:

- `Path`: the relative path from the working directory to the sample image.
- `Effect`: the label assigned to the image at the path in `Path`, which can be either an integer or an uppercase letter. If it is an integer, then it also represents the number of steps by which the pitch changes due to the effect of the sign. If it is an uppercase letter (A or B), then the neume represented has no vocalic value, and the pitch remains unchanged.

## Notes about the training dataset

- The samples in the training set are extracted from multiple typographic works and manuscripts.
- In addition to the typical differences between samples corresponding to the same sign, the training set includes a group of distinctly shaped neumes with the same effect (label).

## Notes about the evaluation dataset

- The evaluation dataset is a CSV file with two fields: `subtaskID`, always having the value 1. `datapointID`, containing the relative path to the image representing the neume sequence to be recognized.
- Neume sequences in the images have a length between 1 and 15 distinct signs and are ordered from left to right.
- All neumes present in the sequences intended for recognition are found in the training dataset.
- Images may contain small artifacts or visual defects, so preprocessing is required.

## Notes about the output data format

The output file is a CSV file containing three fields:

- `subtaskID`: always the value 1.
- `datapointID`: the relative path to the image representing the neume sequence, in the same order as in the training set (in other words, the value of the `Path` field).
- `answer`: the recognized sequence, in the form of a sequence of integers separated by the `|` character, where each number represents the accumulated relative distance from the initial pitch up to the current sign, inclusive.

### Example

For the following sequence:

> 𝁇𝁕𝁇𝁆𝁆𝁑𝁘 𝁇𝁑𝁑

The individual tonal meaning of the neumes is 

```
1, -2, 1, 1, 1, -1, none, 1, -1, -1
```

and in the output file the sequence would be

```
1|-1|0|1|2|1|1|2|1|0
```

## Scoring

For each sequence in the output file, 1 point is awarded for correctly determining the number of neumes.

If the number of neumes is correct, an additional 1 point is awarded for each correctly classified neume.

For example, if the expected output was `1|2|0|0|1` but the actual output is `1|2|0|2|3`, the score for this result is 5 (out of a maximum score of 6).

The final score is the ratio of the total score obtained to the maximum possible total score (3354), expressed as a percentage, rounded up to the nearest whole number.
