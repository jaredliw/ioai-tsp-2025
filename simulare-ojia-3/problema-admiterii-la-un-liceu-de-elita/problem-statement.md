# Elite High School Admission Problem

An extremely important step in the personal development of each student is admission to a prestigious, elite high school. You will develop a model that predicts, based on several results, whether a candidate will be admitted to an elite high school (`status_admitere = 1`) or rejected (`status_admitere = 0`). You will train the model using the training dataset `train_data.csv` provided, and then generate predictions using the dataset `test_data.csv`.

## Dataset Description

The training dataset (`train_data.csv`) contains the following columns:

- `id` (natural number): The candidate’s identification number – a unique natural number.
- `gen` (M or F): the candidate's gender – M for male or F for female.
- `judet` (string of 2 characters corresponding to Romanian counties): the candidate’s county.
- `NT` (1.00–10.00): the admission test grade (float with 2 decimals).
- `MEV` (6.00–10.00): the grade from the national evaluation (float with 2 decimals).
- `MATE` (5.00–10.00): the average middle school grade in mathematics (float with 2 decimals).
- `MGIM` (5.00–10.00): the overall middle school grade average (float with 2 decimals).
- `status_admitere`: a binary variable where 1 indicates the candidate was admitted, and 0 indicates the candidate was rejected.

The prediction dataset (`test_data.csv`) contains:

- 180 samples with the same features (`id`, `gen`, `judet`, `NT`, `MEV`, `MATE`, `MGIM`) as the training set, but without the column `status_admitere`.
- Your model will generate predictions for these samples.

## Expected Output

A .csv file named `output.csv`, which includes the following 3 columns: `subtaskID`, `datapointID`, and `answer`, exactly as in `sample_output.csv`.

The value in the column answer contains the correct response to subtask `subtaskID` for the row `datapointID` from `test_data.csv`.

- **Subtask 1 (20 points):** `dif_NT-MEV` – representing the difference between the admission test grade `NT` and the national evaluation grade `MEV` for each candidate, with 2-decimal precision (different values for each row).

- **Subtask 2 (20 points):** `loc-MEV` – representing the ranking position of candidates based on the national evaluation grade `MEV` (distinct integer values per row).

- **Subtask 3 (60 points):** `status_admitere` – with your model’s predictions, 1 for admission, and 0 for rejection.

## Scoring

- Submitting the `sample_output.csv` file will grant 5 points.

## Remarks

Remove columns that are not relevant for prediction. Standardize numeric columns. There are no missing rows. Check the Starter Kit section for orientation details.
