# Exam Score Prediction

For this problem, you need to implement a regression model capable of predicting the exam score (`Exam_Score`) using a provided dataset. The dataset is organized in a CSV file, and the modelâ€™s performance will be evaluated based on the **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**.

**The dataset contains the following columns:**

- `ID`: Unique identification number of the student.
- `Hours_Studied`: Number of hours spent studying.
- `Attendance`: Percentage of attendance in classes.
- `Parental_Involvement`: Level of parental involvement in education (Low, Medium, High).
- `Access_to_Resources`: Access to educational resources (Low, Medium, High).
- `Extracurricular_Activities`: Participation in extracurricular activities (Yes/No).
- `Sleep_Hours`: Average number of sleep hours per night.
- `Previous_Scores`: Previous exam scores.
- `Motivation_Level`: Student's motivation level (Low, Medium, High).
- `Internet_Access`: Internet access for studying (Yes/No).
- `Tutoring_Sessions`: Number of tutoring sessions attended.
- `Family_Income`: Family income (Low, Medium, High).
- `Teacher_Quality`: Quality of teachers as perceived by the student (Low, Medium, High).
- `School_Type`: Type of school (Public/Private).
- `Peer_Influence`: Influence of peers on the student (Negative, Neutral, Positive).
- `Physical_Activity`: Number of hours of physical activity per week.
- `Learning_Disabilities`: Presence of learning difficulties (Yes/No).
- `Parental_Education_Level`: Education level of the parents (High School, College, Postgraduate).
- `Distance_from_Home`: Distance between home and school (Near, Moderate, Far).
- `Gender`: Gender of the student (Male/Female).
- `Exam_Score`: Target variable, the exam score (numerical value, the prediction objective).

## Tasks

For the first tasks, you will need to load the dataset and perform a series of statistical analyses to better understand the dataset you'll be working with.

### Subtask 1 (10 points)

Based on the training dataset, calculate the average value of the `Hours_Studied` column, representing the number of hours students spent studying.

Afterwards, for each student in the test set, determine the absolute difference between the actual number of study hours (`Hours_Studied`) and the average calculated from the training set.

### Subtask 2 (10 points)

Based on the values in the `Sleep_Hours` column, determine for each student in the test set whether they sleep a reduced number of hours.

We consider that a student sleeps too little if they sleep less than 7 hours.
For students who sleep too little, mark the value as `True`, and for those who do not, mark it as `False`.

### Subtask 3 (10 points)

For each student in the test set, determine how many students in the training set had a previous score (`Previous_Scores`) greater than or equal to that student's score.

### Subtask 4 (10 points)

For each student in the test set, determine the number of students in the training set who had the same motivation level (`Motivation_Level`) as that student.

### Subtask 5 (60 points)

The main goal of this subtask is to build a machine learning model that predicts the `Exam_Score` based on the provided features in the dataset.

The model must generalize well to new data and will be evaluated on the test set using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as the metric.

## Notes on the dataset

- The target field is `Exam_Score`, a numeric value representing the student's exam performance.
- The model must be trained on `train_data.csv` and evaluated on `test_data.csv`.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Performance:** The model should achieve the lowest possible MAE.

### Note

If you submit `sample_output.csv`, you will receive 6 points.
