# 🤾‍♂️ Caloric Consumption

## Task

Implement an AI/ML model to predict the caloric consumption of an activity using a training dataset `train_data.csv` and a test dataset `test_data.csv` (for which only predictions are required).

The dataset contains the following fields with the corresponding meanings:

| Column         | Description                                                                   |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `User_ID`      | The ID of the user who performed the activity.                                |
| `Gender`       | The user's gender.                                                            |
| `Age`          | The user's age.                                                               |
| `Height`       | The user's height in cm.                                                      |
| `Weight`       | The user's weight in kg.                                                      |
| `Duration`     | The duration of the activity.                                                 |
| `Heart_Rate`   | The average heart rate during the activity.                                   |
| `Body_Temp`    | The average body temperature during the activity.                             |
| `Calories`     | The number of calories burned during the activity (present only in training). |

**Notes about the dataset:**

The target attribute is `Calories`. Given the other attributes, the goal is to predict `Calories` for the test dataset. The evaluation metric used is MAE (Mean Absolute Error between predicted and actual values).

## Requirements

### Part 1 (20 points)

Based on the training dataset, calculate the following:

"`Samples`, `No.Males`, `AverageDuration`, `SeniorUsers`"

- **Subtask 1:** `Samples` – the number of rows in the training dataset.
- **Subtask 2:** `No.Males` – the number of training examples that describe activities performed by male users.
- **Subtask 3:** `AverageDuration` – the average duration of activities in the training set.
- **Subtask 4:** `SeniorUsers` – the number of users in the training set who are at least 75 years old.

Each of the 4 subtasks is worth 5 points.

### Part 2 (80 points)

- **Subtask 5 (60 points):** Develop an AI/ML model and perform the prediction for the `Calories` attribute for each example in the test file where the column `Subtask` has the value 5.
- **Subtask 6 (20 points):** A male handball team needs to estimate caloric consumption to optimize the players' diet. Develop an AI/ML model and perform the prediction for `Calories` for each example in the test file where the column `Subtask` has the value 6.

## Output Format

A CSV file `output.csv` that must include the following 3 columns:

- `subtaskID` – the number of the subtask (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6).
- `datapointID` – refers to the `User_ID` column in `test_data.csv`.
- `answer` – the answer corresponding to the datapoint for the respective subtask.

**Note:** For Subtasks 1, 2, 3, and 4, which require a single answer for the whole dataset, output only one row with `datapointID` set to 1.

Submit a single CSV that contains the answers for all the subtasks you have completed. To see an example, download the file `sample_output.csv`.
